# Tit Tit Kitchen (Backend Server)

## Description

Tit Tit Kitchen is a full-stack web application (based on the MERN stack).

## Deployed live version: https://tit-tit-kitchen.netlify.app/

## Backend server repo: https://github.com/hymced/project-management-server
## Backend server API: https://project3-mern-recipes-server.adaptable.app/api/

## Story

Tit Tit Kitchen is named after a combination of the French expression "bon apÃ©tit" and the Vietnamese sweet and neat way of saying it, just like this app! ðŸ˜ƒ

## How does it work

This repository contains the backend code for the server of this application. It is a RESTful API built with ExpressJS, MongoDB and Mongoose.

It allows logged in users to manage all the recipes and all the ingredients in the database (public except for anonymous users). The main feature is that they can also track the ingredients they have in their kitchen and plan their meals in a week plan view. On a daily basis for a week, user can then consume the ingredients of the planned recipes that he/she actually cooked and ate. Stay tuned for more functionalities to come!

## DB Relationships
1. One-to-many (1:many) â†’ A user has multiple ingredients (directly stored in the userâ€™s model, and not as embedded sub documents or references as of now).
2. One-to-one (1:1) â†’ A user as only one week plan and reciprocally.
3. One-to-many (1:many) â†’ A recipes as multiples ingredients, but ingredients can be used in more than 1 recipe.
3. There are no relations between the public models and users.

## Frontend Resources

### Frontend client (React app) repo: https://github.com/hymced/project-management-client

## Instructions

To run in your computer, follow these steps:
- clone 
- install dependencies: `npm install`
- create a `.env` file with the following environment variables
  - ORIGIN, with the location of your frontend app (example, `ORIGIN=https://mycoolapp.netlify.com`)
  - TOKEN_SECRET: used to sign auth tokens (example, `TOKEN_SECRET=ilovepizza`)
- run the application: `npm run dev`

# Environment variables
